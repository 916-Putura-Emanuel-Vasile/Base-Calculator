    The application must implement algorithms for:
    -	arithmetic operations for positive integers: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division by one digit,
        in a base p from {2,3,...,9,10,16}
    -	conversions of natural numbers between two bases p,q from {2,3,...,9,10,16} using the substitution method or
        successive divisions and rapid conversions between two bases p,q from {2, 4, 8, 16}.
    The application must have a menu such that all operations and conversion methods to be verified separately.
